# Introduce
* I've been studying Deep Learning since a few years ago. but I started studying and stopped again, and repeated.
<br>because I wanted to do using the DL for project at my company.<br> We started development for the project(action recognition for training in military), but we stopped in three months. It was not profit for my company. <br>Anyway my knowledge was shallow. So I have heard Andrew Ng's course on Cousera.
* This repo is my programming assignment and quiz of [*Andrew Ng's*](http://www.andrewng.org/) special couse **"Deep Learning Specialization"**.
* This course consist of five courses as follows.

## Course 1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
